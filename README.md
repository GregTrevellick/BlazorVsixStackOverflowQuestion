# BlazorVsixStackOverflowQuestion

A simple repo containing code for a [StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55424046/unable-to-set-apk-meta-data-using-google-api-dot-net-client).

The code is an AzureDevOps widget written using Blazor.

<!--
## Vsix generation

 To re-create the issue / generate the vsix file that is uploaded to [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GregTrevellick.BlazorWidget) do the following:

  - Run ```VsmpBuilder.bat``` in the root of the ```BlazorVsixStackOverflowQuestion``` project

 This batch file will

  - Build & publish the project as a set of static asset files for the website
  - Generate a vsix file from the static asset files

 When running yourself you will likely need to 

  - Alter the path names in the batch file 
  - Alter the content of the ```vss-extension.json``` manifest file which drives the generation of the vsix file
